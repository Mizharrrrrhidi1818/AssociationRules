        "In today’s competitive retail landscape, understanding why customers dont buy just what they buy is critical for strategic decision-making. Traditional market basket analysis, which mines co-purchases of specific products (e.g., “Binders → Paper”), often struggles with sparsity and limited generalizability, especially in catalogs with thousands of SKUs. To address this, this study adopts an attribute-value association rule mining approach on the Sales Forecasting dataset (Kaggle: rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting), treating each order not as a list of products, but as a behavioral profile defined by semantic features, such as order value tier, shipping urgency, customer segment, and time of purchase. By doing so, we uncover high-level purchasing behaviors that directly inform bundling strategies, logistics optimization, and retention campaigns.\n",

        "\n",
        "This approach let me uncover not just product affinities, but decision contexts: urgency, value tier, segment, and timing, all of which open doors to smarter bundling, logistics tuning, and retention strategies."

This isn’t random; it reflects a complete workspace setup behavior, think desk + chair + monitor + printer + binders + paper. The high conviction (2.54) confirms that if any one of these categories is missing, the order is unlikely to be high-value.\n",

Rather than prescribing generic “frequently bought together” prompts, we now have statistically validated, operationally actionable profiles each with clear strategic levers. Future work will integrate these rules into a real time recommendation engine and A/B test their impact on basket size and customer lifetime value."
